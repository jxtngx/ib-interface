Thank you for your interest in contributing to ib_interface.

Given this project is more open core than it is open source, I do not plan to accept contributions given my intended use case.

If you have an ib_insync related question, please join their [groups.io message board](https://groups.io/g/insync). Please do not post ib_interface questions there, as the code owners of ib_insync are not familiar with ib_interface.
